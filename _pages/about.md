<p align="justify">
I am a Ph.D. candidate at the <a href="http://www.cs.ucla.edu/">CS@UCLA</a>.
  I work under the supervision of <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~kwchang/">Dr. Kai-Wei Chang</a>.
<!--   Previously I was a Ph.D. student at the <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/">CS@UVA</a> from August 2015 to August 2017. In fall 2017, I moved to UCLA with my advisor <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~kwchang/">Dr. Kai-Wei Chang</a>.  -->
  My research focus spans the areas of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning.
  My Ph.D. thesis topic is on transfer learning for low-resource NLP. 
  My research works deal with learning universal language representations utilizing data from heterogeneous sources, designing new learning objective to bridge the gap between different learning signals, and developing flexible model architectures to enable cross-domain and cross-language transfer.

  <b><font color="brown">Research Objective</font></b> -  Developing computational algorithms that (1) reduce the amount of labeled data required to train NLP models from scratch; and (2) adapt to new domains and languages with fewer labeled examples.

I have received my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering from the <a href="http://cse.buet.ac.bd/">CSE@BUET</a>, in February 2013 and Master of Computer Science from the <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/">CS@UVA</a>, in August 2017. In my free time, I like to solve problems to improve my programming skills and also contribute to the community. I have given <b><font color="brown">500+</font></b> answers to programming related questions and earned <b><font color="brown">20,000+</font></b> reputation on StackOverflow.
