I am a Scientist at Qatar Computing Research Institute. I have completeded my Ph.D. from <a href="http://www.cs.ucla.edu/">CS@UCLA</a>
  and was advised by <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~kwchang/">Prof. Kai-Wei Chang</a>.
  My research interests span the areas of information retrieval, natural and programming language processing (e.g., English, Python). 
  Previously I was a Research Scientist at Bosch Research, Sunnyvale, USA (Aug 2022 to Dec 2023). 
  During my Ph.D., I got the opportunity to work as a research intern at Google Reserach (Summer 2021), Facebook AI Research (Summer 2020), Salesforce Research (Summer 2019), and Microsoft AI & Research (Summer 2018). I have received my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering from the <a href="http://cse.buet.ac.bd/">CSE@BUET</a>, in September 2015.
