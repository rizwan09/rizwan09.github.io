Adherence to drug usage guidelines for prescription and over-the-counter drugs is critical for drug safety and effectiveness of treatment.
Drug usage guideline documents contain advice on potential drug-drug interaction, drug-food interaction, and drug administration
process. Current research on drug safety and public health indicates patients are often either unaware of such critical advice or overlook
them. Categorizing advice statements from these documents according to their topics can enable the patients to find safety critical
information. However, automatically categorizing drug usage guidelines based on their topic is an open challenge and there is no
annotated dataset on drug usage guidelines. To address the latter issue, this paper presents (i) an annotation scheme for annotating safety
critical advice from drug usage guidelines, (ii) an annotation tool for such data, and (iii) an annotated dataset containing drug usage
guidelines from 90 drugs. This work is expected to accelerate further release of annotated drug usage guideline datasets and research on
automatically filtering safety critical information from these textual documents.
