  Abstractâ€”We demonstrate a microscopic traffic simulator
with mixed simulation capability that mimics real traffic scenarios
in a virtual environment using real road network topology and
real traffic data. The purpose of our project is to evaluate
alternative transport options in Dhaka city. We have constructed
two different versions of the proposed traffic simulator: the first
one is a standalone application based on java and the other one
is a parallel version based on C++. The constructed simulator
receives network topology, driver behavior, and origin-destination flow as input. The simulator generates vehicles for each origin-
destination pair based on the provided parameters, visualizes the
flow of vehicles, and provides statistics. The visualization allows
decision makers to identify different traffic events visually and
the statistics allows them to analyze the events.
